## 1. Your vs. You're: The Difference That Changes Meaning

### Why People Get It Wrong
These words sound identical but have completely different meanings.

### The Simple Rule
| Correct Usage | Example | Incorrect Version |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Your** (possession) | "Is this your phone?" | ❌ "You're phone" |
| **You're** (you are) | "You're going to love this!" | ❌ "Your going to" |

### Memory Trick
> "If you can replace it with 'you are,' use **you're**. Otherwise, use **your**."

## 2. There vs. Their vs. They're: The Trio That Confuses Everyone

### Quick Reference Table
| Word | Function | Correct Example | Common Mistake |
|------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **There** | Place | "The book is over there" | ❌ "Their it is!" |
| **Their** | Possession | "Their house is big" | ❌ "There house" |
| **They're** | Contraction | "They're coming later" | ❌ "There coming" |

### Pro Tip

## 3. Its vs. It's: The Tiny Apostrophe That Causes Big Problems

### The Golden Rule
- **Its** = Belonging to it  
  *"The cat licked its paws."*  
- **It's** = It is/has  
  *"It's been raining all day."*

## 4. Then vs. Than: The Comparison Mistake

### The Core Difference
| Word | Usage | Example | Common Error |
|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Then** | Time sequence | "We ate, then left" | ❌ "She's taller then him" |
| **Than** | Comparisons | "Better than before" | ❌ "More then enough" |

### Quick Test
> "If you're comparing, use **than**. For time, use **then**."

---

## 5. Affect vs. Effect: The Verb/Noun Mix-Up

### The Rule
- **Affect** (verb) = Influence  
  *"Rain affects traffic."*  
- **Effect** (noun) = Result  
  *"The law had no effect."*

### Exception
"Effect" as verb = Bring about  
*"The CEO effected changes."* (Rare usage)

## 6. Who vs. Whom: The Formal Challenge

### When to Use
| Word | Role | Example | Trick |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| **Who** | Subject | "Who called?" | Replace with "he/she" |
| **Whom** | Object | "Whom did you meet?" | Replace with "him/her" |

### Modern Usage
> "In informal contexts, **who** often replaces **whom**."

## 7. Me vs. I: The Pronoun Problem

### The Removal Test
1. Remove the other person:  
   - "John and __ went" → "I went" → **"John and I"**  
   - "Give it to John and __" → "Give it to me" → **"John and me"**

### Common Error
❌ "Between you and I" → ✅ "Between you and me"

---

## 8. Fewer vs. Less: Countable vs. Uncountable

### The Rule
| Word | Used With | Example | Mistake |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Fewer** | Countable nouns | "Fewer apples" | ❌ "Less people" |
| **Less** | Uncountable | "Less water" | ❌ "Fewer time" |

### Exceptions
- Time/Money: "Less than 5 minutes" (despite being countable)

---

## 9. Could Of vs. Could Have: The Sound-Alike Error

### Why It Happens
- "Could've" sounds like "could of"

### Correct Forms
| Incorrect | Correct | Contraction |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| ❌ "Could of" | ✅ "Could have" | "Could've" |
| ❌ "Should of" | ✅ "Should have" | "Should've" |

---

## 10. Apostrophe Catastrophes

### Common Errors
1. **Plurals**: ❌ "Banana's" → ✅ "Bananas"  
2. **Possessive its**: ❌ "The dog lost it's collar" → ✅ "its collar"

### The Rule
> "Apostrophes show possession (*Mary's book*) or contractions (*don't*), NEVER plurals."

(Implies the bus was running)
